Basically, I'm fine with you using my stuff however you want, but my stuff is inextricably intertwined with Moon Toad, Cepheus, and Traveller, and you either need to use the OGL or get a pile of other special permission to use their stuff.





In addition to the above, I request (but do NOT require) that if you use this, you do the following:
 - Notify me
 - Release any derivative works in a similar spirit
